# MVP Development Guidelines

## Local Development Setup
- **Pattern**: `scripts/**/*`
  - Development environment:
    ```yaml
    # Core components
    components:
      ├── frontend        # React/Vite development
      ├── backend         # FastAPI service
      └── database        # Local PostgreSQL
    ```

## Environment Configuration
- **Pattern**: `*/.env*`
  - Environment setup:
    ```yaml
    environments:
      ├── .env.development  # Local development
      └── .env.test         # Testing environment
    ```
  - Keep secrets in .env files (not committed)
  - Use .env.example as template

## Database Setup
- Local PostgreSQL:
  - Simple connection setup
  - Basic migrations
  - Development data seeds
  - Regular backups

## Media Storage
- Local file system storage:
  - Organized directory structure:
    ```yaml
    storage:
      ├── uploads/         # User uploads
      ├── audio/          # Audio files
      └── previews/       # Generated previews
    ```
  - Regular local backups
  - File size limits

## Development Workflow
- Git workflow:
  ```yaml
  branches:
    ├── main             # Stable version
    ├── develop          # Development
    └── feature/*        # Feature branches
  ```
- Code review process
- Testing before merge

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual testing checklist
- Test data management

## Dependencies
```yaml
# Core development tools
python: ">=3.9"
node: ">=16.0.0"
postgresql: ">=13.0"

# Package managers
pip: "latest"
npm: "latest"
```

## Local Setup Checklist
- Environment setup
- Database initialization
- Dependencies installation
- Test suite running
- Local server startup

## Security Basics
- Secure authentication
- Input validation
- File upload validation
- Basic rate limiting
- CORS configuration
