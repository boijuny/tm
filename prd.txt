Background and Objectives
Background
Problem Statement: Many artists and beatmakers struggle to find compatible collaborators, share creative visions, and initiate joint music projects through conventional social media or streaming platforms.
Vision: Build an intuitive, playful platform that transforms the search for creative partners into an interactive experience. Drawing inspiration from Tinder's swipe and match mechanics, this app will foster creative collaborations and build a dynamic community of musical talent.

Objectives
Streamline Collaboration: Connect artists (vocalists, rappers, composers) with beatmakers (producers, DJs, instrumentalists) through an intuitive matching interface.
Enhance User Experience: Deliver a sleek, web-first design with an engaging user interface that's inspired by Tinder's simplicity and fluidity.
Drive Engagement: Introduce core features (audio previews, basic filters, messaging tools) to facilitate creative partnerships.
