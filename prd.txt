Background and Objectives
Background
Problem Statement: Many artists and beatmakers struggle to find compatible collaborators, share creative visions, and initiate joint music projects through conventional social media or streaming platforms.
Vision: Build an intuitive, playful platform that transforms the search for creative partners into an interactive experience. Drawing inspiration from Tinder's swipe and match mechanics, this app will foster creative collaborations and build a dynamic community of musical talent.

Objectives
Streamline Collaboration: Connect artists (vocalists, rappers, composers) with beatmakers (producers, DJs, instrumentalists) through an intuitive matching interface.
Enhance User Experience: Deliver a sleek, web-first design with an engaging user interface that's inspired by Tinder's simplicity and fluidity.
Drive Engagement: Introduce core features (audio previews, basic filters, messaging tools) to facilitate creative partnerships.

2. Application Overview
User Registration and Profile Creation
Simple Onboarding: Sign up using email or Google authentication.
Detailed Profiles: Users can set up comprehensive profiles including:
- User Type: Choose whether you're an Artist, Beatmaker, or both
- Bio and Background: Detail musical influences and experience
- Media Uploads: Add 1-2 audio clips as creative samples
- Basic Links: Connect to SoundCloud or YouTube

Matching Mechanism
Browse Interface: Users browse through profiles with like/pass buttons.
Basic Matching: Consider user preferences such as musical genre and project type.
Reciprocal Matching: A match is confirmed when both users show interest.

Interaction Tools
In-App Messaging: Text chat with basic audio file sharing.
Audio Previews: Listen to audio snippets directly within profiles.
Basic Contact: Share contact info after matching.
